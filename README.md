[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/rdepena/node-dualshock-controller)

`dualshock-controller` is a node library that exposes events from a ps3 (ps4 partially supported) dualshock controller connected.

## Installation:

### Linux Requirements:

    * libudev-dev

### Run npm command: ###

    $ npm install dualshock-controller


### Connecting the controller

Obviously the controller needs to be connected but you can connect the dualshock controllers in two ways:

Via Bluetooth: just make sure you pair with the controller via bluetooth.

Via USB: once the controller is connected to the computer make sure you press the playstation button located in the center of the controller. Important: THE CONTROLLER WILL NOT SEND ANY DATA IF YOU DO NOT PRESS THE PS BUTTON.


### Use the DualShock library

~~~~ js
var dualShock = require('dualshock-controller');

//pass options to init the controller.
var controller = dualShock(
    {
        //you can use a ds4 by uncommenting this line.
        //config: "dualshock4-generic-driver",
        //if using ds4 comment this line.
        config : "dualShock3",
        //smooths the output from the acelerometers (moving averages) defaults to true
        accelerometerSmoothing : true,
        //smooths the output from the analog sticks (moving averages) defaults to false
        analogStickSmoothing : false
    });

//make sure you add an error event handler
controller.on('error', err => console.log(err));

//connect the controller
controller.connect();

//control rumble and light settings for the controller
controller.setExtras({
  rumbleLeft:  0,   // 0-255 (Rumble left intensity)
  rumbleRight: 0,   // 0-255 (Rumble right intensity)
  red:         0,   // 0-255 (Red intensity)
  green:       75,  // 0-255 (Blue intensity)
  blue:        225, // 0-255 (Green intensity)
  flashOn:     40,  // 0-255 (Flash on time)
  flashOff:    10   // 0-255 (Flash off time)
});

//add event handlers:
controller.on('left:move', data => console.log('left Moved: ' + data.x + ' | ' + data.y));

controller.on('right:move', data => console.log('right Moved: ' + data.x + ' | ' + data.y));

controller.on('connected', () => console.log('connected'));

controller.on('square:press', ()=> console.log('square press'));

controller.on('square:release', () => console.log('square release'));

//sixasis motion events:
//the object returned from each of the movement events is as follows:
//{
//    direction : values can be: 1 for right, forward and up. 2 for left, backwards and down.
//    value : values will be from 0 to 120 for directions right, forward and up and from 0 to -120 for left, backwards and down.
//}

//right-left movement
controller.on('rightLeft:motion', data => console.log(data));

//forward-back movement
controller.on('forwardBackward:motion', data => console.log(data));

//up-down movement
controller.on('upDown:motion', data => console.log(data));

//controller status
//as of version 0.6.2 you can get the battery %, if the controller is connected and if the controller is charging
controller.on('battery:change', data => console.log(data));

controller.on('connection:change', data => console.log(data));

controller.on('charging:change', data => console.log(data));
